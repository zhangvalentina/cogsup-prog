Exercise 2.1

Task:

Write a for-loop that prints out the following line 20 times:

 zzzzzz

Exercise 2.6

Task:
------
Write code that prints out the following sequence WITHOUT initializing an empty string:
 1
 12
 123
 1234
 12345

Hint: The function print takes an argument called 'end', which specifies what
to print at the end of the input string. By default, this parameter is set to \n, 
which is why the script moves automatically to a new line after the execution
of a simple print-statement.

"""
Exercise 2.7

Task:
------
Write code that uses a variable called 'rows'. If 'row' is equal to 1, it should print:
  o

If rows equals 5, it should print:
     o
    ooo
   ooooo
  ooooooo
 ooooooooo

You should be able to give any value to row and see a triangle made out of 'o's. 

Hint: Before you start coding, think what set of instructions (algorithm) 
your code needs to carry out for a certain value of rows.

Exercise 2.8

Write code that prints the multiplication table:

on how to align the numbers.
